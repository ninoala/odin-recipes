        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Saute the spinach in oil (or water) in a large skillet over medium heat. Transfer the spinach to a bowl or colander to cool.</li>
            <li>Toast the English muffins.</li>
            <li>Whisk the eggs, milk, onion powder, salt and pepper in a medium mixing bowl until combined. Add the cooled spinach. Drain the spinach to avoid discoloring the egg mixture.</li>
            <li>Spray a sheet pan generously with olive oil. Pour the egg and spinach mixture into the sheet pan. Bake at 350 F about 20 minutes until the eggs are cooked through.</li>
            <li>Remove the eggs from the oven and cool completely. Cut into 6 equal squares. Split and toast the English muffins.</li>
            <li>Place the base of each English muffin on each of the pieces of parchment (or foil). Top each with one egg patty, a cheddar slice, and the top of the English muffin. Wrap the foil around the sandwich. Refrigerate and enjoy within 2 days or place all sandwiches into a freezer-safe bag or container to freeze. Enjoy within about 3 months.</li>
